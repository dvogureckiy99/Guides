# Hi, dudes!

This guide is for you just to give an idea how to create good report! It it splitted into parts, so I hope you will use it for your reports!

## Common

1. Always write next parts: 
    - **Objective** - what you`re going to achieve,
    - **Description** - explaint what work includes and which theoretical basis it has undelying, 
    - **Picture(-s) of your system** - just to have better representation of the system to work with, don`t forget about description of each part on the picture,
    - **Conclusion** - describe the results you`ve achived.
2. Never end any part of your work with table/figure. Any chapter of the work must be ended with a bunch of text.

## Charts / Plots

1. The description of the plot must be before representation! What I mean is:
> The plot in the figure 2 represents transient responses with aplied external distirbances at the moment 0.1 sec.  
> ...  
> Figure 2. Response characteristics.
2. Don`t forget about units! It is neccessary to set certain units cause without them people can not understand what charts represent.
3. Plot title and suscription - the feature is to show what chart represent.
4. Axes names - explain what axes are responsible for.
5. Transient response chart better have straight line representing steady-state level.
6. Representation of multiple plots in the figure must be subscribed with letters 'a', 'b', ...
> The plot is represents in the figure 4b.
