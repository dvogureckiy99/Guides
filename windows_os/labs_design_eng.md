# Hi, dudes!

This guide is for you just to give an idea how to create good report! It it splitted into parts, so I hope you will use it for your reports!

## Common

1. Always write next parts: 
    - **Objective** - what you`re going to achieve,
    - **Description** - explaint what work includes and which theoretical basis it has undelying, 
    - **Picture(-s) of your system** - just to have better representation of the system to work with, don`t forget about description of each part on the picture,
    - **Conclusion** - describe the results you`ve achived.
2. Never end any part of your work with table/figure. Any chapter of the work must be ended with a bunch of text. As a common thing, at the end of the chapter you can describe your results.

## Charts / Plots

1. The description of the plot must be before representation! What I mean is:
> The plot in the figure 2 represents transient responses with aplied external distirbances at the moment 0.1 sec.  
> ...  
> Figure 2. Response characteristics.
2. Dont forget about units! It is neccessary to set certain units cause without them people can not understand what charts represent.
3. Plot title and suscription - the feature is to show what chart represent.
4. Axes names - explain what axes are responsible for.
5. Transient response chart better have one more straight line representing steady-state level.
6. Representation of multiple plot images in the figure must be subscribed with letters 'a', 'b', ...
> The plot is represented in the figure 4b.
7. If your transient response reached steady-state level in 0.4 seconds, the full time of plot should not be more than 0.6 seconds. The common rule - steady-state should file not more than 20 percent of full plot time.
8. Representation of external disturbances influence. The show how external disturbance affects your system, you should start external disturbance signal **only** after your system reached stady state.
